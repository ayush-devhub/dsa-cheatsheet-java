**1. The Industry Reality**
<p>LeetCode is heavily algorithmic and rarely reflective of actual engineering roles. Most languages possess core libraries that handle these tasks more efficiently than manual implementation. In 15 years of building complex business logic for major financial institutions, I have never needed LeetCode-style solutions.</p>

**2. A Senior Dev's Attempt**
<p>I attempted LeetCode for the first time today:

Question 1: Stuck for 45 mins due to poor wording. Solved only after moving to an actual IDE.

Question 2: Gave up completely. It was a math problem, not a coding problem.</p>

**3. The Verdict**
> "Don't be disappointed in yourself if you struggle. You can still be a success."

<p>You can lead teams, build mobile apps, and create desktop systems that millions use without mastering these specific puzzles. If you aren't writing drivers or doing heavy math, this is mostly irrelevant to your worth as a developer.</p>
